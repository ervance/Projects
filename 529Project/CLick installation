CLick installation:
You'll have to compile the element source along with the rest of the project. Here are the instructions to do that from scratch:

git clone https://github.com/kohler/click/
cd click
./configure --prefix=$HOME/click-inst --enable-local
cp <path to element source>/iperfelement.hh element/local/
cp <path to element source>/iperfelement.cc element/local/
make elemlist
make install
~/click-inst/bin/click <path to iperf.conf>

usage:
~/click-inst/bin/click <path to .conf>
